# Creating something for bass tablature

Trying to use AI to process audio and create bass tablature that makes it easy for me to read.
I personally can learn songs by ear, but I do this by memorizing how the sound sounds. Because
if I don't know what comes next in the song, I obviously won't know what bass note comes after.
This project will hopefully be a way for me to generate quick sheet music so I can easily play
along with any track I want, or maybe even pick up on some knicks like notes I can't figure out
or licks that I can't sound out.
